[CURVE SPACE DEFORMATION]
### Prepare Curves
1. Select main rootmotion control
2. Select IKs like feet and hands
3. Convert movement to curves
4. Rebind controls to curves with Motion trails and sync timings

### Setup Deformation Space Relationship
1. Get curves list
2. Get latest curve from list as a deformation curve
3. Create a "Sweep Mesh" on deformation curve with "Line" profile, interpolation mode "Start To End" and steps
4. Connect other curves to "Sweep Mesh" with "Wrap" deformer using "Volume" falloff mode

### Organize objects in one group per space deformation
- Parent each top level object to the group
- Use unique naming with naming converter
