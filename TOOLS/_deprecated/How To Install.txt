DEPRECATED. NEED TO WRITE NEW INSTRUCTION LATER

Hello there. This is a short guide how to install scripts to your Maya.

1. If you have an archieved file, extract it to any convenient folder. For example you can use C:\Users\Username\Documents\maya\scripts\FOLDER_NAME
2. If you have a repository, so you just need to clone this repo. (then you need to this path 'MayaToolbelt\Scripts\MyScripts\Tools')
3. Go to C:\Users\Username\Documents\maya\scripts\ and open your "userSetup.py" file.
4. If your folder doesn't contain this file, you need to create it manually. Just create new txt file and change extension while renaming.

5. Copy and Paste 2 lines below to "userSetup.py" file (you need to put the path of your script folder instead of 'C:/...')
import sys
sys.path.append('C:/Users/Username/Documents/maya/scripts/FOLDER_NAME')
