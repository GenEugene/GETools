1. Extract archive and put the GETools folder where you want it to be.
For example: "C:/Users/Username/Documents/maya/scripts/GETools"

2. Drag and Drop the "DRAG_AND_DROP_INSTALL.py" file into Maya viewport.
GETools will be added to the current shelf as new button.

3. Enjoy!



p.s. Let me know if you see any issues, it's really help to fix bugs and develop GETools faster. Thank you.
