# Known issues:
- Overlappy in loop mode bake incorrectly when rootmotion used
- If Maya uses interface scaling, some UI elements can be stretched or aligned incorrectly
- UI Buttons are not aligned perfectly
- Overlappy module depends on framerate. Physics will behave different on 20/30/60/+ framerates.
