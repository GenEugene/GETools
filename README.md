# GETools
Maya scripts for rigging, animation and other

# This plugin is under development.

The idea is to mix all my scripts to one tool. I have a lot small and very useful algorithms, Overlappy script for secondary animation and other. So, when it will be done, I will rewrite this description and add instruction for use.

Also plan to create video tutorial about features and how to use them.
