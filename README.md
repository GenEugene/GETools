# GETools
Autodesk Maya animation and rigging tool

---

# Description
The idea is to mix all my scripts to one tool. I have a lot small and very useful algorithms, Overlappy script for secondary animation and other. So, when it will be done, I will rewrite this description and add instruction for use.

Also plan to create video tutorial about features and how to use them.

# Known issues:
- [CRITICAL] Overlappy module works unstable, not recommended to use yet
- Undocking creates new window with refresh all values. Will be fixed later
- Folding issue with CenterOfMass/Weights/Manual and */Weights/HumanoidBodypartsPercentage
